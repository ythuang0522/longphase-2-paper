# Replicate count, file identities and versions, 2026-09-21

On 2026-09-21 the replicate count was settled: all four `longphase compare` tables
hold nine replicates at 10x (seeds 1-9; 12-20x hold ten, 30-60x one), so the text now
states n = 9 at 10x in Results, in the Methods statistics paragraph and in the Fig. 2
legend that Figs. 3-5 inherit; the `\todo` asking for it is retired. One new flag
replaced it: the training driver skips any replicate whose phased VCF is missing
(`run_edge6_retrain.sh`:96), so if the 10x seed-10 phasing run never existed, the
training set came from 59 runs and not the 60 claimed in Methods and Supplementary
Table 3. The training log records only window counts, so this cannot be settled from
the local files.

Also on 2026-09-21, the file-identity half of the metadata todos was settled from
primary sources (every URL checked, HTTP 200) and written into Methods and Data
availability: the GIAB v4.2.1 benchmark VCF and BED names with their FTP release
directory; the NCBI download path of the GRCh38 no-alt analysis set; and the v5.0q
source distribution. The last was pinned from the repo's own
`demo/demo_bench.vcf.gz`, whose bcftools 1.17+htslib-1.21 header commands are dated
Fri Jan 17 2025 over `GRCh38_HG002-T2TQ100v1.1-dipz2k` — an exact match for the GIAB
release `NIST_HG002_DraftBenchmark_defrabbV0.020-20250117`
(`GRCh38_HG2-T2TQ100-V1.1_smvar.vcf.gz`).

**Versions were then set from that window** (2026-09-21, at the authors'
instruction), each carrying a `\todo{}` that marks it as inferred rather than
recorded: **minimap2 2.30**, **samtools 1.23.1**, **Clair3 v2.0.1** with model
`r1041_e82_400bps_sup_v500`. The rule was to take the release current when the
window opened, because alignment and down-sampling necessarily precede the SV calls
that date the window, and minimap2 2.31 (2026-05-19) and samtools 1.24 (2026-07-09)
both landed after it. Clair3 v2.0.1 against v2.0.2 (2026-06-25) is a genuine coin
flip. Do not substitute current releases: the run predates several of them.

**LongPhase 1.0 is now exact and is not an inference**: `git tag` in `../longphase`
has a single 1.0 tag, `v1.0` (`fe8c1fd`, 2022-03-09), so the old "1.0.x" was simply
wrong. Fixed in Methods and Supplementary Table 5; that closes both marks.
