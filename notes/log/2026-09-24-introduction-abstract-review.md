# Introduction and abstract review, 2026-09-24

**Introduction and abstract review, 2026-09-24.** Novelty claim kept as "no
*published* method places all four evidence classes in one model" (author decision,
not to be re-raised): the indel/5mC co-phasing in LongPhase releases 1.5–1.7 is
unpublished development of LongPhase 2 and is not cited separately. HiPhase is cited as
the only published joint indel+SV phaser (HiFi only). Headline numbers now match Results:
2.6–5-fold fewer switch errors (v5.0q,
with correction; 1.1–1.3-fold under v4.2.1), six- to eightfold faster *at 60×*, and
+40% block N50 for *corrected* co-phasing (75% was uncorrected, at a higher switch
error rate). "GNN scores every variant" corrected (entropy scores every variant; the
GNN scores windows around PE ≥ 0.8). HapCUT2 contrast softened to "not designed to";
"calibrates" → "weights". Abstract cut to under 150 words. Aligned in the same pass:
the Results SNV heading now says 2.6- to 5-fold; "calibrated" → "weighted" in Results
and the Fig. 1 caption; the Discussion's first paragraph states that no published method combines all four
classes and recasts the co-phasing contribution as "the extra evidence is not free"
(75% uncorrected, 40% corrected); "most read-based tools" report binary phase (HapCUT2
does not); the HapCUT2-pruning contrast is stated as an expectation, with an
`[optional experiment]` comment for the matched comparison. The co-phasing Results
heading ("up to 75% but raises the SNV switch error rate") was left as is: it
describes uncorrected co-phasing and is accurate.
