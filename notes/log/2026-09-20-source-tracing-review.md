# Source-tracing review, 2026-09-20

The 2026-09-20 review resolved every mark that could be settled by tracing the
source (`../longphase` at cc17fb1 plus the working-tree fixes, and the training
chain in `GNN source/`): the copy-number mismatch load, the vote-less `PE = 0` case
(block starts only), the indel phased-fraction denominator and `compare`'s
exact-allele matching rule, the central-zone rule of the GNN, thread-count
independence of `phase` (by construction, not by experiment), the unsupervised
status of SV/5mC corrections, Sniffles2 2.8.0 (from the VCF header of the 10x
replicate-1 SV calls shipped as `demo/demo_sv.vcf.gz`), the reference and v5.0q
file names, and replicate s.d. for the LongPhase 2 values quoted at 10x. Two new
flags came out of it: the repository README times `phase` (v2.0, 24 threads) at
39–180 s, five times faster than Fig. 2e, and `demo/demo_snv.vcf.gz` carries
PEPPER-Margin-DeepVariant headers, not Clair3 headers.
